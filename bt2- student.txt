contract StudentRecord {

    // Structure to hold student data
    struct Student {
        uint id;
        string name;
        uint age;
        string course;

    // Array to store students
    Student[] public students;

    // Event to log student addition
    event StudentAdded(uint id, string name);

    // Fallback function (triggered when contract receives Ether or invalid call)
    fallback() external payable {
        // Simply accept Ether and log event

    }

    // Receive function (for plain Ether transfers)
    receive() external payable {

*************************************************

🧾 1. Short Summary

This Solidity program stores student data (ID, Name, Age, Course) using a struct and an array.
It allows adding new students, viewing individual student details, and checking total student count.
It also includes fallback and receive functions to handle Ether transfers.

📘 2. Theory

Smart Contract: A small blockchain program that executes on the Ethereum network.

Struct: A user-defined data type used to group related information (like student details).

Array: A dynamic list that stores multiple student records.

Events: Used to log actions (e.g., when a student is added).

Fallback & Receive Functions: Handle Ether sent to the contract — used for accepting payments or catching invalid function calls.

⚙️ 3. Algorithm

Step 1: Define a Student struct with fields: id, name, age, and course.
Step 2: Declare an array students to store multiple student records.
Step 3: Write a function addStudent() to:

Take input parameters.

Create a new Student struct.

Push it into the array.

Emit an event StudentAdded.
Step 4: Write getStudent() to return a student’s details by index.
Step 5: Write getStudentCount() to return total number of students.
Step 6: Add fallback and receive functions to handle Ether transfers and emit Received event.

🧩 4. Key Concepts Explained
Concept	Explanation
Struct	Combines multiple data types under one name (like a class in OOP).
Array	Stores multiple student records dynamically.
Event	Logs blockchain actions for monitoring (e.g., when a student is added).
Memory Keyword	Used for temporary data (like strings in functions).
Mapping vs Array	Here we use an array since we want to list all students sequentially.
Fallback Function	Executes when a non-existent function is called or plain data is sent.
Receive Function	Executes when Ether is sent without data.
Public Keyword	Makes data/functions readable externally.
View Function	Reads data from blockchain (no gas fee off-chain)

🎓 7. Conclusion

This contract demonstrates how Solidity handles structured data using structs and arrays.
It also shows event logging, fallback/receive functions, and data retrieval techniques.
Such programs are foundational for decentralized apps that store and manage records securely on-chain.

🎤 8. Top 10 Viva Questions & Answers
No.	Question	Answer
1	What is the purpose of a struct?	To group related data of different types under a single name.
2	Why do we use memory for strings?	Because strings are reference types and need temporary memory allocation inside functions.
3	What is the difference between view and pure?	view reads state variables; pure neither reads nor modifies them.
4	What is an event in Solidity?	An event logs data to the blockchain, which can be read off-chain.
5	How is student data stored?	In a dynamic array of Student structs.
6	What does fallback() do?	It runs when a contract receives Ether or invalid function calls.
7	What is the receive() function used for?	Specifically handles direct Ether transfers without data.
8	Why use require() in getStudent()?	To prevent invalid index access and ensure contract safety.
9	Can anyone add a student?	Yes, as written — the function is public. Access control can be added later.
10	What happens if Ether is sent to the contract?	The receive() or fallback() function is triggered and emits a Received event.

🏁 10. Quick One-Line Recap

👉 “This Solidity program creates a digital student record system using structs and arrays, allowing addition, retrieval, and count of students, and safely handles Ether transfers with fallback and receive functions.”
